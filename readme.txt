Detects and blocks Google Side-Wiki. Can be set to not run if Side-Wiki is not detected.

== Description ==

Imagine your competition writing whatever they want about you on the 
SideWiki that pops up on your site... They can steal your traffic, 
write untrue reviews about your products, and basically ruin your 
business!

Look, Side-Wiki may be a very good thing in many instances bringing 
good traffic to your site, bringing powerful backlinks and great 
reviews, but the fact that it is not under your control in the 
event the worst happens leaves you with few options...

You can't turn this off either, because Side-Wiki is not part of 
your site, instead it resides in a tool bar program that accesses 
the Google Database for comments about your site that others have 
posted. Others...like your competitors or those who just don't 
like you!

And these comments can go to specific areas of your site, 
highlighting words, phrases, images, anything!

But there is something you can do about it!

The Ultimate Side-wiki Blocker - simply the best and most configurable
side-wiki blocker out there.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the zip file into your plugins directory into its own folder.
2. Activate the plugin in the Plugin options.
3. Customize the settings from the Options panel, if desired.

Enjoy.
